      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Consider for a moment the information around you- perhaps you work in or own a business where information floats all around you; right when you organize everything, a new wave of information rushes in and overwhelms you. Or perhaps you might be an endless list-maker, who can never seem to keep recorded information organized and updated as you might like. What other information might you like to have automatically sorted and updated for you?
        That’s the difference this website makes in your life; that’s the impact this service could have on your life.
        I develop programs that will compile and display information however you like.
        Any sorting, comprehensive, and data-based interests are taken care of at your leisure.
        </p>
