        <p>Hey everyone, I'm from Eugene, Oregon. My major is Virtual Design and Construction. I love learning
            new skills, and now find myself learning computer programming. Some of my favorite hobbies include
            playing piano, listening to audio books, cooking, and playing games. I love meeting new people and 
            am looking forward to a great semester with you all!
